# Treasure Hunt Manager
Simple web app for managing a treasure hunt

Treasuer Hunt - A treasure hunt in the context of this app invloves a number of teams solving clues whilst driving a route devised by the organisers.  Each clue includes directions such as "Take the next right" and a riddle that can be solved by spotting the answer as they are driving.  

The winning order of teams is decided by a combination of how many clues they get right and their time taken to complete the hunt.  For example if 2 teams both got the same number of clues correct, the team that had the quickest time would come first.

The purpose of this application is to record team information and results and then display the results of the treasure hunt.

I have chosen to use Angular 2 which is still in beta at time of writing and npm as the package manager.

#Instructions for Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. cd to the root directory
3. Install node modules - `npm install`
4. Start the dev server - `npm start`

A web browser should open automatically but if not open one and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.  As you make changes to the code with the server running, the web browser will automatically refresh to show those changes.
